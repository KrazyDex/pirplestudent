  <h1>Jamaican Jerk Chicken Recipe</h1>
  
  <!-- Introduction -->
    <p>It is said that Jerk Chicken originates 
    from the time the Maroons brought African 
    techniques for cooking meat to Jamaica, which
    was then combined with native island seasoning 
    and ingredients. The word “Jerk” may have its roots in
    “charqui,” a Spanish word for dry meat, or it may derive 
    from “jerking,” or poking holes in the meat to hold spices 
    cooking.</p>
